The accounts will remain available to you until 1/21, after which all content will be deleted as these accounts will be used in other trainings.\r\n\r\nGo to [**http://esrit3g.maps.arcgis.com**](http://esrit3g.maps.arcgis.com) to log in for this workshop.\r\n####Get Started\r\nSign in and click *MAP* at the top of the page to open the map viewer.\r\n\r\nTake the guided tour for a quick overview.\r\n####Add Data\r\n**File formats:** CSV, Excel, ESRI Shapefiles (zipped), GPX files, KML/KMZ, [and more](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/create-maps/add-layers.htm)\r\n#####Search for Layers\r\nUse this feature to find datasets posted in your organization, a group, on the web, or on ArcGIS Online. \r\n\r\nStart by looking within the *NEASIST Workshop 2015 Group*.\r\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cferwerda/NEASIST_workshop/master/img/agxo_searchforshp.jpg \"Search for Layers within the NEASIST group\")\r\n\r\nClick the *Add* link next to civilwar_battles to add the layer to your map.\r\n\r\nTry finding others layers within ArcGIS Online.\r\n#####Add Layer from File\r\nUse this feature to add your own datasets. Shapefiles must be compressed in a zip archive (*.zip) before uploading. Browse for the file on your computer, then add it.\r\n\r\n#####When a File Contains >1000 Features\r\nYou can't simply add upload it to your map. Instead, go to *MY CONTENT* and use the *Add Item* drop-down menu to upload the file from your computer. Once the file has been uploaded, return to your map and choose *Add | Search for Layers*, and look for the layer in My Content. Note that sometimes layers with >1000 features will render slowy, so you may want to filter them to show only a subset (see below for how!).\r\n\r\nMore details [here](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/create-maps/add-layers.htm).\r\n####Style Your Map\r\nClick on the drop-down arrow next to a layer to see many options.\r\n* **Change Symbols**: adjust the symbol type, color, and size. Try out the settings to see how they work, or check out [the help](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/create-maps/change-symbols.htm) for details.\r\n* **Configure Pop-ups**: format the pop-up info windows, including which fields are visible. Try adding images or graphs! More details [here](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/create-maps/configure-pop-ups.htm).\r\n* **Display Images/Videos in Pop-Up Windows**: Your layer should have a column/variable containing a link to an image/video for each feature. You can then select this field under Pop-up Media when you’re configuring pop-ups.\r\n* **Create Labels**: automatically add labels to your map.\r\n* **Animate Your Map to Show Change Over Time**: if you have a [time-enabled](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/create-maps/configure-time.htm) layer in your map, then you can use the timeline at the bottom of the map to adjust how the data are viewed. The civilwar_battles layer is time-enabled. If you *don't* wish to show the timeline, click on the drop-down arrow next to the layer and select *Disable Time Animation*.\r\n* **Copy**: Copy a layer if you want to show multiple variables (for example, obesity in 2000 vs. 2010).\r\n\r\n####Perform Analysis\r\nUse built-in tools to perform basic spatial analysis (buffers, calculate distances, combine datasets, etc.)\r\n\r\nRead [the help](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/use-maps/perform-analysis.htm) for a detailed description of each tool...or just give them a try!\r\n\r\n####Save & Share Your Map\r\n**Regularly save your map (there’s no auto-save).** Click the *Save* menu at the top of the screen and give it a good name with at least one tag. It will be saved in *My Content*.\r\n\r\nUse the *Share* button at the top of the screen to share your map.\r\n* Share with the NEASIST Workshop group so that others can see your map.\r\n* Share the map via a link.\r\n* Embed the map in a web site (must be shared with Everyone) or make a separate webapp. See the next section for details about making a webapp!\r\n \r\n####Make a Story Map\r\nDecide what story you want to tell first. For example, if you're working on the Civil War project do you want to focus on all battles in a particular year? Only decisive battles? Battles in a particular area or involving particular commanders?\r\n\r\nPublish your map using one of the templates. This is a great way to make good-looking [story maps](http://storymaps.arcgis.com) with images and text.\r\n\r\n1.\tClick Share, share your map with the NEASIST group, then click the *Make a Web Application* button.\r\n2.\tFor now, look under *Configurable Apps*. Hover over a template for details. Click *Publish* under a template, then either Preview or Publish it.\r\n  * For something like a tour of Civil War sites, check out Story Map Journal or Story Map Tour. \r\n  * The Time Aware template allows you to animate change over time, but it can be buggy.\r\n3.\tAfter publishing the map, change the settings and appearance of the app. Click the *HELP* button at the top for tips. To only show certain features, click the *Organize* button and then hide the features you don't want to show.\r\n  * If you are creating a story map journal or tour, use the *Change Media* button over the image to choose which photo or video to show for each point.\r\n4.\tWhen you’re happy with your map, click the *Share* button and copy the link.\r\n5.\tFor more details, check out [the help](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/create-maps/create-map-apps.htm)\r\n\r\n---\r\n###<a name=\"cartodbhead\"></a>CartoDB     <http://cartodb.com/>\r\nGo to the website to sign up for a free account. Chrome is the recommended browser for this tool.\r\n####Add Data\r\n**File formats:** CSV, Excel, ESRI Shapefiles, and GPX files\r\n\r\n1. Go to your CartoDB dashboard (https://yourusername.cartodb.com/dashboard/)  and click *New Table* (the big plus sign in the right side of the screen).\r\n2. Now you have several ways to bring in datasets. Two common options:\r\n  * *Upload Data:* Shapefiles must be compressed in a zip archive (\\*.zip) before uploading. Choose *select a file* or drag and drop the zip file onto the New table window.\r\n  * *Import from URL:* Paste a URL to a data file into the field. The URL should be to a supported file type. For example, if we want to import a layer showing libraries in MA from the MassGIS website, the .html URL for the [datalayer’s info page](http://www.mass.gov/anf/research-and-tech/it-serv-and-support/application-serv/office-of-geographic-information-massgis/datalayers/libraries.html) won’t work; instead, we want the direct link to the libraries.zip file, which is the [*Download this layer: ESRI Shapefile* link](http://wsgw.mass.gov/data/gispub/shape/state/libraries.zip). ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cferwerda/NEASIST_workshop/master/img/massgis_libraries.jpg \"MassGIS Data Site\")\r\n  * Additional help: http://docs.cartodb.com/tutorials/import_shapefile_in_cartodb.html\r\n\r\n####Make a Map\r\n#####View Your Data\r\n  ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cferwerda/NEASIST_workshop/master/img/cartodb_datamapview.jpg \"2 views to work with data in CartoDB\")\r\n\r\n* **Data View**: Once you add data, you will first see it as a table in Data View. This shows you the variables for each feature (row) in the dataset as a spreadsheet. You can use this table view to format, query, and edit the data. It's a good idea to check that numbers are stored as numbers and not strings at this point.\r\n\r\n* **Map View**: This shows you the data located on a map – you may need to zoom or pan to it.\r\n\r\n#####Style Your Data\r\nThe map view allows you to change how the data look on a map; however, if you want to share your map with others, then you should create a visualization – click *Visualize* in the top-right corner of the screen. \r\n\r\nNext, use the [tools in the sidebar](http://docs.cartodb.com/cartodb-editor.html#cartodb-sidebar) on the right side of the screen in Map View to change the appearance of the data in the map. \r\n\r\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cferwerda/NEASIST_workshop/master/img/cartodb_wizard.jpg \"the style wizard\") Start with the [Wizards tool] (http://docs.cartodb.com/cartodb-editor.html#wizards) to change the colors and size, or to make a chloropleth map. Within each way to style the data, you can change the appearance of it in the map. Try out the settings to see how they work, or check out [the help] (http://docs.cartodb.com/cartodb-editor.html#wizards) for details.\r\n\r\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cferwerda/NEASIST_workshop/master/img/cartodb_infowindow.jpg \"the info window tool\") Next, change what shows up in the [info windows] (http://docs.cartodb.com/cartodb-editor.html#info-windows) by clicking on the tool and adjusting which fields are visible.\r\n#####Add Map Elements\r\nClick the *Add Element* button on the lefthand side of the screen. This allows you to add a legend, text box, annotation (linked to a particular location & zoom level), or image (e.g., a logo). Simply drag and drop to move them to the desired location, and click on an element to activate the formatting toolbar. Click [here] (http://docs.cartodb.com/cartodb-editor.html#add-element) for more details.\r\n\r\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cferwerda/NEASIST_workshop/master/img/cartodb_legend.jpg \"the legend tool\") To add a legend, use the [Legends tool] (http://docs.cartodb.com/cartodb-editor.html#legends) in the right-hand side bar. This is particularly useful if the colors on the map are meaningful (i.e., more than simple symbology).\r\n#####Add Another Layer to the Map\r\nClick the blue plus sign at the top of the right-hand toolbar to *Add layers* and then find the layer you want. You can select an existing layer or upload a new one.\r\n\r\nYou can toggle between the layers in the right-hand toolbar to change how each is styled. [More details](http://docs.cartodb.com/tutorials/multilayer_overview.html)\r\n#####Animate the Map to Show Change over Time\r\nNote that this only works for point data (not polygons or lines). The tool called [Torque](http://docs.cartodb.com/tutorials/introduction_torque.html) allows you to animate your data based on a numeric value.\r\n\r\nIn the Wizard tool, find Torque. It will be automatically enabled in the Visualization wizard if you are working with a point layer.\r\n####Share Your Map\r\nUse the *Share* button in the top-right corner to share your map.\r\n\r\n####Learn more about CartoDB\r\n* [Use SQL to interact with, query, and edit your data.](http://docs.cartodb.com/tips-and-tricks.html#the-power-of-cartodb)\r\n* [Tutorials](http://academy.cartodb.com/)\r\n* [CartoDB Map of the Week](http://blog.cartodb.com/categories/map-of-the-week/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n###<a name=\"timemaphead\"></a>TimeMapper  <http://timemapper.okfnlabs.org/>\r\nNote: We didn't cover TimeMapper in the workshop, but it's a simple and handy little tool to have in your kit.\r\nTo use TimeMapper, you need a Google account so that you can create a Google spreadsheet. Creating a TimeMapper account is optional, but it allows you to edit your maps later on.\r\n####To learn how to use it:\r\n*First*, watch the 1 minute tutorial on the website.\r\n\r\n*Then* look at the example Civil War [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E_r2WyxQmk7SNQhjeWBWz_R6Pv-DMe8kZjHb3TOM9GA/edit?usp=sharing) and [map](http://timemapper.okfnlabs.org/carolinferwerda/civil-war-battles-timemapper-example-spreadsheet).\r\n\r\n*General steps:*\r\n\r\n1. Decide what you want to focus on. (All battles in a particular year? Only decisive battles? Battles in a particular area or involving particular commanders?)\r\n2. Create a new spreadsheet with the points of interest. Format the spreadsheet so that TimeMapper can read it.\r\n3. Find any additional media for each battles (an image or youtube video) and paste the link in the Media column of the spreadsheet. Fill in source information, descriptions, etc. This is the part where you can customize the message of the map!\r\n4. Publish the map according to the instructions on the TimeMapper website. Share the link to your map with others!\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Data Sources\r\n* **State and county outlines:** Global Administrative Areas database, <gadm.org>\r\n* **US adult obesity by state:**  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
